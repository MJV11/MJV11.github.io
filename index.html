          I have refreshed my website again. Every year, I get a little better at web development, and so every year, it seems 
          pertinent to update my portfolio.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          After working with Three.JS experimentally and after being inspired by some of the amazing constructions I've seen online,
          I aspired to be able to recreate a similar centerpiece on an my site. 
          15,000 choreographed triangles make quite the visual spectacle.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          The main visual is built with WebGL via Three.JS. However, I didn't use the PlaneGeometry module in the API.
          Instead, I added the vertices myself by creating a custom object derived from the InstancedBufferGeometry
          module,
          allowing me to transform the vertices individually by manipulating voxels, as well as give me creative control
          over the shaders.
          The main animation is built programmatically, instead of with 3D modeling, allowing seamless transitions
          between the parallelepipeds and the other animations. Though more complicated, I beleive the customization 
          resulted in a superior product.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          After constructing the triangles, I transform and mutate vertices in groups of indices, indices in groups of polygons, and polygons
          in units of solids.
          The positions, velocities, colors, and sizes of these units are acheived by sequentially manipulating
          the triangles as vectors. (Unfortunately, this means an side effect is that the speed of the animation is contingent
          on a user's graphics card. It's very fast on the new Apple M2 chips).
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          All of these animation patterns are written in the vertex shader.
          Instead of writing a bunch of animation methods inside the object in Javascript, I transform vertices matrices by
          manipulating
          vectors directly in the shader, which significantly reduces processing time, allowing me to add thousands of triangles to the
          animation
          without exploding a viewer's computer.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          This is done by manipulating the animationValue coefficients, an attribute I built in to the object created in Triangles.js.
          It determines which animations to apply. When set to zero, an animation cannot be triggered.
          When set to one, that animation parameter is then applied to the positions vector.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          Because the animationValue is set instantly across all triangles,
          but processing those triangles happens sequentially inside the vertex shader,
          the resulting switch from one pattern to another allows seamless transitions between the two animation patterns
          These transitions are drawn out a few extra seconds by creating intermediary
          frames with Tween.JS, which interpolates the intermediary positions between the start and end points.
          . 
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          The RBG color transition is also quite interesting. Instead of writing an algorithm in the fragment shader, I
          built it in to the vertex shader to save memory. To change colors,
          I applied trigonometric functions to noise values multiplied by coefficients activated
          by animationValues, and then multiply those by their own position. These values output an HSV-described
          color, which is prefered
          over RBG because I can (1) achieve the full spectrum of colors and (2) avoid black and white.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          I then pass those values to an HSV to RGB conversion that transforms the
          HSV vector into an RGB vector. Aftewards, I increment the triangle
          colors by that vector, resulting in softly changing colors.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          In the end, voila: a mesmerizing canvas of dancing triangles.

          Zephyr is a Connect IQ Data Field for Garmin Edge cycling computers that provides real-time wind and 
          precipitation information based on your current location.
          
          Designed for cyclists who want to stay informed about weather conditions during their rides.

          It features current wind speed and direction, percipation, and automatic updates by GPS position.
          Zephyr has been tested and confirmed to work on the Garmin Edge 530. Other Connect IQ capable

          In this project, my team and I programmed a computer to play a game of chess using a UR-10 robot arm
          with a smart suction cup that can pick up custom chess pieces using haptic search, a searching technique that we 
          improved upon for the UC Berkeley Embodied Dexterity lab.

          The brain of the opponent is done by utilizing the stockfish API to analyze an encoded board state and return the 
          best moves, which the robotic arm then performs. The arm relies upon PID controlled path trajectories between all the 
          squares, relying on calculating the coordinates of each square by knowing where the center of the board is with color 
          thresholding and the size of each square. The suction cup is actuated by a solenoid to control the flow of air in 
          and out of a vacuum generator. The hand of the robot knows when it has grabbed a peice because it can measure the
          pressure of the cup. The cup has 4 chambers with individual pressures. If a pressure reading in one cup is less than another,
          the robot knows that it must move in the opposite direction to actuate all four chambers and properly grab the peice, allowing us
          to bypass problems with computer vision and with traditional gripper end-effectors. I lost to the robot, a lot.

          As a software engineer, and an individual in the American labor market more broadly,
          should I be worried about robots stealing my job? I don't know, but LeBron James should be worried about
          my team and I engineering and programming a robot to steal his job. Click the link to see how we designed a
          robot to shoot a basketball with a 100 eFG%, or just keep reading.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          I programmed a Real Sense camera to detect a basketball hoop, which it can identify because of a nueral net my
          team
          and I designed to know what a basketball hoop is. Then, the robot aligns its x axis parallel to the hoop's
          X-axis such that
          the Z-axis of the robot and the Z-axis of the hoop are the same vector. This ensures that there will be
          minimal lateral error in
          the shot. Then, the robot measures the distance between the hoop by calculating the 2D pixel size of the hoop
          against the expected
          size of the the hoop, and calculates a 2D trajectory along the X and Z axes.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          Afterward, the robot simply executes a rotation about the X-axis, releasing the ball along the rotation at the
          point that gives the ball
          the appropriate trajectory. By releasing, I mean inverting the suction cup's pressure with positive pressure
          generated from reversing
          a vacuum through the four chambers of the suction cup used by Berkeley's research lab, which we helped

          I scored 113.2. So definitely do not use my document database. It is not secure. Your top secret Grandma's
          Banana Muffin Recipe WILL leak.
          But it is perhaps more secure than average?

          To implement unique usernames, we hash the username and store it, which also gives us confidentiality should
          the database
          be leaked because the hash is unreversible and the output of a hash will be uniform in length regardless of

          To implement passwords, we first hash the password, and then, given a 16 character output, we then an
          Argon2Key hash to generate the
          stored password. Because Argon2Key hash functions are intentionally slow, they provide security by consuming
          time and compute to crack.

          Next, each user is given a digital signature signing and verification key, which are then stored in the same
          database with a hash of the username
          and the string "DS Signing Key", for recoverability but continued opaqueness. Each user is also given a public
          decryption
          and private encryption key for asymmetric encryption, and they are stored similarly, but the public key is
          stored by name lookup so that it is actually
          usable. All data is signed by the user so that when we recover it, we can discover tampering should an

          of the owner's key and HMACed to verify integrity.
          When shared, new users gain access to the file's key and store it in their own user data. When access is
          revoked, the entire file is decrpyted, re-encrypted
          a new permuation, and that key is shared with the users who still have access, ensuring that if a previous
          user had the file data locally
          or could hack into the database and find the new file, they could still not decrpyt it.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          In the end, the only information availible to an adversary is the length of the file. The number of files and
          users is unknown. The content
          of files and users is unknown. All tampering is discovered by secure HMACing and signing. Pretty secure!

          For the class final in CS61b, we were required to demonstrate our understanding of software engineering
          principles by creating a video game. What data structures will you choose? What algorithms will you employ?
          How will you organize your classes and methods? How will you test your project to verify that it functions
          properly, even despite odd edge cases?
          I engineered an 2D tile-based world engine that generates an interactive labyrinth world in Java. World
          generation is predicated on Randoms derived from seeds, so the world is psuedorandom -- able to be regenerated
          with the
          same seeds. First, centers are randomly placed. Rooms are built around these centers in random sizes. Then, a
          Weighted
          Quick Union algorithm connects all the rooms, ensuring that all are navigable and connected.

          Beyond the main menu and basic world layout, I decided to go further than the project spec,
          adding some polish and intrigue to the game. I programmed persistence via save files,
          dynamic lighting predicated on line of sight vision, scoring and high scores, a way to win, interactive
          light sources, and a dynamic HUD.

          Line of sight vision is predicated on a Breadth First Search algorithm that only grants vision on seeable
          paths. In other
          words, light sources do not give vision around corners. Victory is contingent on lighting up all the rooms
          in the shortest
          period of time, making the game a speedrun. I think it's little touches like this that make a world of
          difference to users. Despite being easier to construct than an engine, they are the features that matter the
          most to a
          player and provide the interest that foments immersion.

          In this project, I gathered datasets on words, their usage per year, their synonyms, and their hyponyms.
          A hyponym is a word that shares an is-a relationship with another word. Then, much like google can chart words and their 
          popularity by year, I too developed a browser-based viewport with the same function. Additionally, given a word, this tool
          can display a word and its hyponym graph with a custom depth,
          charting the relationships between these words. The project encodes each word with a
          unique number and stores the hyponym relationships in a custom graph datastructure built atop a hashmap. Then, utilizing 
          more hashmaps, I then created a dictionary to map between words and numbers and visa-versa. I used timeseries treemaps to 
          organize popularity data. When a user gives the browser tool a word, it can then traverse these maps to generate the requested
          data, which is finally outputted back into the window, alphabetized by another handy tree set.

          As a researcher and developer in Political Computer Science @ Berkeley and someone who cares deeply about
          fairness,
          I learned about an ML model used in our criminal justice system that attempts to predict recidivism, the
          likelihood
          of commiting another crime after a release from prison, called COMPAS.
          This model is used to set bail, parole, and sentences, and includes race as one of the primary factors it
          considers.
          Beyond that, the model is only 66% accurate, which is abysmal given that it is used to shape a defendant's
          life, and moreover,
          is only 40% accurate when predicting innocence / no risk. Worse still, COMPAS refuses to show the inner
          workings of their model,
          making the judicial system also a black box via its implementation. See the presentation for all the awful
          weaknesses.
          Is it possible to build a more accurate model that does not include race? I decided to find out.

        <div class="work-description hidden">
          At the end of the semester, I presented the model and my findings at a symposium on campus.
          My most accurate model was built on XGBoost, with 75% validation accuracy. However, given that it is
          relatively hard
          to explain to a layperson on a jury or on a bench, I reccomended an alternative as well.
          A three-factored logistic regression model acheives 70% cross-validation accuracy, which is still better
          than the industry standard,
          but also accessible to a jury.

          In CS61A, we were required to demonstrate our ability to understand and write algorithms
          by creating a Scheme interpreter. Do people still use Scheme? Minor details.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          I designed an interpreter that prompts users for scheme code, then parses that user generated code,
          tokenizes it by white space,
          and then evaluates it by recusively calling eval and apply code with Python.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          Beyond this basic functionality that achieves the minimum requirements to call something an interpreter,
          I went futher,
          optimizing the interpreter to handle some of the unique architectural advantages of Scheme, including
          visually appearance and
          tail recursion optimization.
          Whereas Python saves each environment that a recursive method is called within, even if no recombination
          follows, thereby potentially
          inducing major memory consumption, Scheme is designed such that recursive calls that lack a
          recombination step simply override the
          current environment, effectively utilizing storage.
        </div>
        <div class="work-description hidden">
          How does one use a language without tail recursion optimiztion to support that very feature in one that
          does? Ironically, with iteration.
          By iteratively calling evaluation and application methods within a while loop, instead of recusively
          calling them as was suggested
          by course staff, it was possible to achieve this functionality.
